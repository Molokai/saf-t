A project has been initiated within the Norwegian Tax Administration to focus on the part of SAF-T Financial that has not been utilized in Norway: SourceDocuments (along with the associated tables in Masterfiles). According to the plan, the entire SAF-T Financial format will be available for users starting January 1, 2027. Concurrently, work is being done to improve the format, including ensuring relevant content aligned with current requirements, legal obligations, and user-friendliness. We aim to be transparent and will regularly publish information about the work carried out in the project. The documents published in connection with the work on the project will primarily be in Norwegian.
