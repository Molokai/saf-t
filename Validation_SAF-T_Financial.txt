We now have two valid XSD schema versions for SAF-T Financial. The submission solution at the Tax Administration has therefore been restructured to handle the possibility of receiving two different XML versions that need to be validated with the correct XSD schema. A version control has been introduced to ensure that the element in the XML file, AuditFileVersion, has version 1.20 (current version) or 1.30 (mandatory from the accounting period starting 01.01.2025).
